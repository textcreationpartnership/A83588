            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>being as it hath pleaſed his Excellencie, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, to appoint me to be your Captain. Therefore I humbly deſire you all to do your endeavours to obſerve my Commands; which Command ſhall never be but for the good and ſervice of His Maieſtie, and High Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and your own ſafeties, againſt thoſe malignant parties which doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their induſtries to breed diſſention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Maieſtie and his great Councell, which at length will prove a deſtruction to his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124002:3"/> people, if God doth not put his hand to the Cauſe. Therefore to render you more capable for this imployment, I have here ſet part of the Rules which you are to obſerve under me.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, That no man ſhall take the Name of the Lord in vain, or any other prophane Oath.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That all men ſhall obſerve the Lords day, excepting when you are upon dutie.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That no man ſhall be drunk or diſorder himſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That no man ſhall bring, or cauſe to be brought, any lewd or uncivill women in his Quarter.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That no man ſhall abuſe his fellows by ill language, or ſtroke, or give them the lie.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That none ſhall play at Cards or Dice, or any Game which is not lawfull. And if any playes above half a Crown at any game which is lawfull, both winner and looſer ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and the money diſtributed to thoſe that gives notice of their gaming.</p>
            <p n="7">7 That every man ſhall give notice to his Officers, what quarrell there is amongſt the Troopers; and in caſe that any knows of the quarrell and doth not hinder it, and give intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to the Officers, both quarreller and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator ſhall be puniſhed.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:124002:4"/>8 That all men ſhall repair to their lodging after the ſetting of the Watch, which will be performed by the ſound of the Trumpet or the touling of the Bell.</p>
            <p n="9">9 That no man upon a March ſhall offer to ſtay behind, or march before the Troop, or go out of his Quarter without licence of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
            <p n="10">10 That no man ſhall offer to ſteal one from another, or any bodie elſe, eſpecially any Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling belonging to Horſe or Armour.</p>
            <p n="11">11 That no man ſhall abate the allowance of his Horſe, or ſell or pawn any of his Armor.</p>
            <p n="12">12 That no man ſhall give any uncivill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in the quarters where they lodge, or as they march, eſpecially to a woman or maid.</p>
            <p n="13">13 That all men ſhall pay for whatſoever they call for, or have from their Landlord or parts where they are billetted.</p>
            <p n="14">14 That none ſhall offer to ſhoot his Piſtoll or Carabine upon exerciſing, eſpecially upon the Watch without command.</p>
            <p n="15">15 That all men ſhall give notice to their Officers, if they hear of any that means to fall off from the ſervice.</p>
            <p n="16">16 That all men ſhall obey the command
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:124002:4"/> of the Officers from the higheſt to the loweſt.</p>
            <p n="17">17 That every man ſhall take notice that he is bound to do his endeavour to bring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign puniſhment any that tranſgreſſeth in theſe Articles; And if they know and do not give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of it, they ſhall be as guiltie as the offendours.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I am confident that he which deſires to do his Countrey ſervice, and expect hereafter to deſerve to be a Commander, ſhall not find this Rule hard to be obſerved; he that is nobly minded ſhall find it eaſie.</p>
            <p>One thing more which I deſire of you all is, that you may love one another; for where there is a true love and unity, there is a bleſſing of God: And where there is a bleſſing of God; there can happen no evill.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that you be carefull of your horſes and armour; for if you neglect that, you can do no good ſervice.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that you live peaceably with all thoſe that ſtands for King and Parliament; flie diſcentions amongſt your ſelves, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with your pay, and extort upon no man. Flie from vices, and no doubt God ſhall bleſſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:124002:5"/> all that you ſhall undertake. And more aſſure your ſelves, if you do your endeavours to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe rules here mentioned, that nothing ſhall be lacking of my part to do you good, and to further you in it.</p>
            <p>If there be any of you that thinks he ſhall not be able to obſerve this, and that this is too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, let him freely ſpeak before his name be liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he ſhall have free leave to change Troop, and to put himſelf under the Command of any other Captain.</p>
